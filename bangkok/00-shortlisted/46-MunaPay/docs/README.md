MunaPay is revolutionizing crypto payments for merchants—create payment links in seconds, collect customer details effortlessly, and automate crypto invoices with ease or integrate our easy to use APIs. Powered by Moonbeam’s XC20 tokens, we make cross-chain payments seamless, secure, and instant across parachains.

### Problems we’re solving

Cryptocurrency payments have multiple upsides over traditional rails including no fees, no charge-backs, and instant settlements, globally connected and accessible from day one, but currently accepting cryptocurrency, let alone polkadot payments is hard!. The three major friction for businesses to accept crypto Payments are:

- Too technical
 - Hard integration and unbearable UX
 - No XC20s support 
 - No mobile support
 A major fraction of Internet users are mobile-native and the upcoming wave of new users will be mobile-heavy too. Still, almost all payment providers don't work well on mobile devices, and the UX is unbearable for users
